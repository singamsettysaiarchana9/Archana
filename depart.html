       <p style="font-style:cursive"> Departments are useful for companies of a certain size, since they allow for a more detailed overview of the performance of each unit within a company. This way, companies are better equipped to improve the most required areas.

For small companies, departments are often of less use - but each company should always be considered separately.The existence of a departmental structure tends to reduce the amount of interaction among the employees of different departments. This can result in sub-optimal solutions that are designed to benefit individual departments, rather than the organization as a whole.</p><hr><hr>
