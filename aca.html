	<p style="font-style:cursive">academic relates to book learning and not always in a good way. An academic discussion back in Plato's Academy was probably something better than what it has more recently come to mean: a discussion that's academic has no place in the real world; it's not practical. An academic might have a PhD in Robotics but not know how to work the TV. It doesn't have to mean stuffy, though, just related to college — like when you need an academic gown for graduation.academic relates to book learning and not always in a good way.An academic discussion back in Plato's Academy was probably something better than what it has more recently come to mean.</p>

<p style="font-style:cursive"><font size="6px" font-family="cursive">In a world that is rapidly changing, it is imperative that education be adapted to meet the challenges of the 21st century. However, education systems are often slow to change and are rooted in traditional, outdated models of teaching and learning. The education system needs to be reimagined, and RealLives is a platform that can play a critical role in this transformation.</font></p>
